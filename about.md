### About me

I live in South Devon, UK and since the start of 2012 I've worked for [Magicseaweed](https://magicseaweed.com), currently as their Lead Senior Mobile Engineer building the best Surf Forecast applications in the world.

I enjoy building iOS, Android and Web applications that are driven via proven best practices. I write test-driven, clean, maintainable code with an excellent knowledge of several languages including Swift, Objective-C, Javascript, and PHP. Focusing heavily on the users' experience, striving for code performance and optimisation.

Before focusing on iOS and Android Development, I helped re-architect and build the revamped front and back-end of Magicseaweed.com.

Previous to this I developed and maintained large scale websites and applications for [Netxtra](https://www.netxtra.net/), working with not-for-profit and professional members’ organisations. Such as NHS Trust, Equity actors union, PACT and Besa.

I started a career in software development after graduating with a BSc. first class honours in Computer Science and Further Mathematics from [UEA](https://www2.uea.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/degree/detail/bsc-computing-science) in Norwich. Whilst there I wrote a project on packet loss compensation techniques in VoIP Systems, I designed and programmed a VoIP system in Java & Matlab; constructing and simulating a virtual IP network in which concealment algorithms were implemented to improve the quality of service under packet loss, ensuring a reliable channel. The Project received a commendation from the Institution of Engineering and Technology ([IET](https://www.theiet.org/)).

What about things outside of technology? Living in the Southwest allows me to do two of my favourite things, surfing and biking every week. When I listen to music it’s usually [Electronic](https://soundcloud.com/michaelbux) or Hardcore/Punk and used to play the guitar actively for 8 years.
